# VP_3D_GridGen

Open Test_3D_grid_determination.m and run in MatLab. 

This codes reproduce the 3D example shown in https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09302, which contains the derivation of new VP.

The derivation of the old VP can be found in https://rc.library.uta.edu/uta-ir/handle/10106/11760/browse?type=subject&value=Image+analysis
